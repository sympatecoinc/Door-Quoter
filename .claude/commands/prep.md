Read CLAUDE.md to understand project instructions and workflow. Then analyze the codebase structure by:

1. Reading the package.json to understand the project tech stack and available scripts
2. Examining the main directory structure (using ls or Glob)
3. Identifying key architectural files (main entry points, routing, database schema, etc.)
4. Understanding the project's purpose and main features

After analysis, provide a concise summary of:
- Project type and tech stack
- Main directories and their purposes
- Key architectural decisions
- Database setup (if applicable)
- Any important patterns or conventions you've identified

Finally, confirm you're ready to work by announcing the current git branch and stating you're ready for tasks.
