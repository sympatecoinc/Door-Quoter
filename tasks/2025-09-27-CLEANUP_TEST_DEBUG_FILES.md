# Review: CLEANUP_TEST_DEBUG_FILES
Date Completed: 2025-09-27 16:30

## Changes Made
- Created 4 new directories: debug/, test/, logs/, temp/
- debug/: Moved 4 debug-*.js files (debug-extra-dollar.js, debug-extrusion-pricing.js, debug-pricing-issues.js, debug-pricing.js)
- test/: Moved 7 test files (test-db.js, test-options-api.js, test-second-extrusion-scenario.js, test-stock-rules.js, test_output.json, test_plan_output.json, test_sliding_output.json)
- logs/: Moved all *.log files (13+ files including prod-proxy.log, dev-proxy.log, proxy-*.log, server.log, staging-proxy.log)
- temp/: Moved temp.html
- .gitignore: Added the 4 new directories to prevent them from being tracked

## Testing Performed
- Directory structure verified: All target files successfully moved
- No files left in root directory that match test/debug/log patterns
- .gitignore updated to maintain clean repository

## Notes
- Root directory is now significantly cleaner
- All test and debug files are properly organized
- Log files are centralized for easier management
- Project structure is more maintainable
