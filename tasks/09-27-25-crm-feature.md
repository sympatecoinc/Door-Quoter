## Migration Details
Database migration creates:
- Customers table with company info, contact details, and status tracking
- Contacts table linked to customers for multiple contact management
- Leads table with sales pipeline stages and probability tracking
- Activities table for tracking interactions with customers and leads
- Projects table updated with optional customer relationship

## Production Readiness
- ✅ Migration file created and tested locally
- ✅ All relationships properly defined with cascading deletes
- ✅ API endpoints include proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Components built with loading states and empty state handling
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined
- ✅ Application builds without errors

## Next Steps for Production
1. Apply migration to production database: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
2. Verify application functionality in production environment
3. Consider adding seed data for demonstration purposes
4. Monitor database performance with new tables and relationships

## Notes
- CRM feature provides complete customer lifecycle management
- Lead pipeline supports standard sales stages: New → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Won/Lost
- Customer and lead data properly integrated with existing project management
- Ready for production deployment and database migration testing
