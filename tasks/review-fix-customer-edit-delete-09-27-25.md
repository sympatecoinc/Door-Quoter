# Review: Fix Customer Edit and Delete Functionality
Date Completed: 2025-09-27 18:09

## Changes Made
- src/components/crm/CustomerList.tsx: Added edit/delete handlers, confirmation dialog for delete operations
- src/components/crm/CustomerForm.tsx: Enhanced to support both create and edit modes with dynamic form population
- src/components/views/CRMView.tsx: Added edit mode support, API handlers for PUT/DELETE operations, and proper state management

## Functionality Implemented
- Edit button in customer list now opens form pre-populated with customer data
- Delete button shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- CustomerForm dynamically switches between "Create" and "Edit" modes
- API integration for PUT (update) and DELETE operations
- Proper state management and data refresh after operations
- Error handling for failed operations

## Testing Performed
- Development server started successfully on port 3001
- All TypeScript compilation passed without errors
- Components properly handle state transitions between create/edit modes

## Notes
- The application is now ready for user testing of edit and delete functionality
- Both operations maintain data integrity and provide user feedback
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Form validation remains consistent across create and edit modes
