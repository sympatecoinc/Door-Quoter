# Review: Docker and GitHub Actions Access Setup
Date Completed: 2025-09-25 16:52

## Changes Made
- No file changes - this was a setup and analysis task

## Testing Performed
- GitHub CLI v2.80.0 installed successfully
- GitHub CLI authenticated with repository access
- Docker daemon access verified and working
- Recent GitHub Actions runs analyzed (10 most recent)
- Failed Docker build logs retrieved and analyzed

## Docker Build Issue Analysis

### Root Cause
The Docker build is failing because **TailwindCSS is missing** from the production dependencies. The error occurs during the `npm run build` step:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'
```

### Timeline of Failures
- Multiple recent builds failing (CI and Deploy to Staging)
- Issue appears to be consistent across recent pushes
- Original Prisma schema issue was resolved, but new TailwindCSS issue emerged

### Technical Details
- Build progresses successfully through dependency installation
- Prisma client generation works correctly
- Failure occurs in Next.js build process when webpack tries to load TailwindCSS
- TailwindCSS is listed as a devDependency but needed for build process

### Solution Required
Move `tailwindcss` from devDependencies to dependencies in package.json, or modify Dockerfile to install dev dependencies during build phase.

## Notes
- Docker daemon access confirmed working locally
- GitHub Actions authentication successful
- All deployment pipeline infrastructure appears functional
- Issue is purely dependency-related, not infrastructure
