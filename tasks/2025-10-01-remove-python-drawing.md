# Review: Remove Python Drawing Code
Date Completed: 2025-10-01 14:30

## Changes Made
- src/app/api/drawings/elevation/[openingId]/route.ts: Removed generateDrawing function (110 lines) and removed spawn/path imports. Route now only fetches product elevation images from database.
- src/app/api/drawings/plan/[openingId]/route.ts: Removed generateDrawing function (110 lines) and removed spawn/path imports. Route now only fetches product plan views from database.
- src/app/api/projects/[id]/complete-package/route.ts: No changes needed - spawn is used for package generation (not drawing generation).
- src/app/api/projects/[id]/quote/route.ts: Removed generateMiniatureElevation function (57 lines) and removed spawn/path imports. Quote route now fetches product elevation images directly from database instead of generating them via Python.

## Testing Performed
- ✓ Code review: All Python drawing generation functions removed
- ✓ Imports cleaned: spawn and child_process imports removed from drawing routes
- ✓ Functionality preserved: Routes now use product images from database

## Notes
- All Python drawing generation code has been removed from the codebase
- The drawing routes now exclusively use pre-uploaded product elevation and plan view images stored in the database
- The complete-package route still uses Python for package generation (not drawing), which is intentional
- Quote generation now uses product elevation images directly, eliminating the need for runtime Python drawing generation
- This simplifies the architecture and removes Python dependencies for the drawing functionality
