# Review: Database Sync Complete
Date Completed: 2025-09-29

## Changes Made
- Synced staging database schema with production using `prisma db push`
- Added 3 missing tables to staging: ComponentLibrary, CustomerFiles, ProductPlanViews

## Verification Results

### Before Sync
- **Staging**: 18 tables
- **Production**: 21 tables
- **Status**: Schema drift between environments

### After Sync
- **Staging**: 21 tables ✅
- **Production**: 21 tables ✅
- **Status**: Both databases in sync with schema.prisma

## Commands Executed

```bash
# Synced staging with current Prisma schema
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:StagingDB123@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable" npx prisma db push
```

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Verified staging table count: 21 tables
- ✅ Verified production table count: 21 tables
- ✅ Prisma migrate status (staging): "Database schema is up to date!"
- ✅ Prisma migrate status (production): "Database schema is up to date!"

## Tables Now in Both Databases

All 21 tables present in both environments:
- Activities
- BOMs
- ComponentInstances
- ComponentLibrary ⭐ (newly added to staging)
- Contacts
- CustomerFiles ⭐ (newly added to staging)
- Customers
- IndividualOptions
- Leads
- MasterParts
- Openings
- Panels
- PricingRules
- ProductBOMs
- ProductPlanViews ⭐ (newly added to staging)
- ProductSubOptions
- Products
- Projects
- StockLengthRules
- SubOptionCategories
- _prisma_migrations

## Summary

### Root Cause
The databases were NOT crossed - they were correctly connected but had **schema drift**. Production had 3 additional tables (ComponentLibrary, CustomerFiles, ProductPlanViews) that were added via `prisma db push` without creating formal migrations.

### Resolution
Used `prisma db push` to sync staging database with the current schema.prisma file, bringing it into alignment with production.

### Current Status
✅ Both staging and production databases now have identical schemas
✅ Both environments report "Database schema is up to date"
✅ Dev, staging, and production all using correct database instances:
- Dev + Staging → `door-app-staging` instance
- Production → `door-app-db` instance

## Notes
- The 3 tables (ComponentLibrary, CustomerFiles, ProductPlanViews) exist in schema.prisma but have no formal migration files
- Consider creating a migration for these tables if you want to maintain formal migration history
- Both databases maintain their own data - no data was copied between environments
