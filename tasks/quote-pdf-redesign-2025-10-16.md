# Quote PDF Redesign with Configurable Pages
Date: 2025-10-16

## Overview
Redesign the quote PDF generation system to support:
1. A dynamic quote page with customer pricing and line items
2. Configurable additional pages (spec sheets, example photos, etc.)
3. All pages combined into a single downloadable PDF document

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Quote System
**Files:**
- `src/components/views/QuoteView.tsx` - Current quote UI component
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/quote/route.ts` - Quote data API endpoint (needs verification)
- Current PDF generation uses html2canvas (client-side) to render quote page

**Current Quote Page Structure:**
- Header: Project name, status, created date, openings count
- Table with columns: Elevation (thumbnails), Opening, Specs, Hardware, Price
- Footer: Subtotal, Tax, Total
- Download creates single-page A4 landscape PDF

### Existing PDF Generation System (Shop Drawings)
**Files:**
- `src/lib/pdf-generator.ts` - jsPDF-based PDF generation for shop drawings
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/complete-package/route.ts` - Complete package generation (Python-based)
- Supports multi-page PDFs with cover pages, elevation views, plan views

## Architecture Decision

### Approach: Server-Side PDF Generation with jsPDF
**Rationale:**
- Consistent with existing shop drawing PDF generation
- Better control over page layout and multi-page documents
- Can combine quote data + attachments + spec sheets in single PDF
- Server-side generation ensures consistent output

## Database Schema Changes

### Add QuoteAttachment Model
```prisma
model QuoteAttachment {
  id           Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  projectId    Int
  filename     String   // Stored filename in uploads/quote-attachments/
  originalName String   // Original upload filename
  mimeType     String   // image/png, image/jpeg, application/pdf
  size         Int      // File size in bytes
  type         String   // "spec_sheet", "photo", "custom"
  displayOrder Int      @default(0) // Order in the PDF
  description  String?  // Optional description/caption
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
  project      Project  @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@map("QuoteAttachments")
}
```

### Update Project Model
Add relation:
```prisma
model Project {
  // ... existing fields ...
  quoteAttachments QuoteAttachment[]
}
```

## Scope

1. `src/lib/quote-pdf-generator.ts` - New quote PDF generation library
2. `src/app/api/projects/[id]/quote/pdf/route.ts` - API endpoint for PDF download
3. `src/components/settings/QuoteAttachmentsTab.tsx` - UI for managing attachments
4. `prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_add_quote_attachments.sql` - Database migration

### Files to Modify
1. `src/components/views/QuoteView.tsx` - Update download button to use new API
2. `src/components/views/SettingsView.tsx` - Add QuoteAttachments tab
3. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add QuoteAttachment model

### Files to Reference (No Changes)
- `src/lib/pdf-generator.ts` - Reference for jsPDF patterns
- `src/lib/pricing.ts` - Reference for pricing calculations

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - Users can upload spec sheets (PDF) and photos (PNG/JPG) in Settings
   - Attachments can be reordered and deleted
   - Quote PDF includes dynamic pricing page + all attachments
   - PDF downloads as single file with proper page breaks
   - Existing quote functionality remains unchanged

2. **Technical Requirements:**
   - Server-side PDF generation using jsPDF
   - Proper file storage in uploads/quote-attachments/[projectId]/
   - File size limits enforced (e.g., 10MB per file)
   - Support for PNG, JPG, and PDF attachment formats
   - Clean cascade deletion when project is deleted

3. **UX Requirements:**
   - Fast PDF generation (<5 seconds for typical quote)
   - Clear file upload interface with progress indicators
   - Attachment preview before PDF generation
   - Drag-and-drop reordering for attachment order

## Design Notes

### Quote PDF Structure
```
Page 1: Cover Page (Optional - nice to have)
  - Company Logo
  - Project Name
  - Date
  - "Professional Quote" header

Page 2: Quote Details
  - Project information
  - Line items table (Opening, Specs, Hardware, Price)
  - Subtotal, Tax, Total
  - Terms and conditions

Page 3+: Attachments
  - Each spec sheet (PDF) embedded as pages
  - Each photo on its own page with optional caption
  - Maintain aspect ratios, center on page
```

### File Storage Structure
```
uploads/
  quote-attachments/
    [projectId]/
      [filename] (e.g., spec-sheet-abc123.pdf, photo-def456.jpg)
```

### Attachment Display Order
- Managed via `displayOrder` field in database
- UI allows drag-and-drop reordering
- API endpoint to update order: PATCH /api/projects/[id]/quote-attachments/reorder

## Technical Considerations

### Image Handling
- Use jsPDF's `addImage()` for PNG/JPG
- Scale images to fit page while maintaining aspect ratio
- Center images on page

### PDF Embedding
- Use pdf-lib to extract pages from PDF attachments
- Embed extracted pages into main PDF
- Alternative: Convert PDF pages to images (simpler but lower quality)

### Performance
- Consider PDF generation timeout (current: 60s for complete package)
- Stream large PDFs if necessary
- Cache generated PDFs with invalidation on project/attachment changes

### Security
- Validate file types on upload (MIME type + extension)
- Scan for malicious content (if needed)
- Limit file sizes (10MB per file, 50MB total per project)

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Template system for quote page design
- Per-customer branding (logo, colors)
- Email quote directly from app
- Quote versioning (track changes over time)
- Default attachments that apply to all quotes

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing Completed:
✅ **Basic Functionality**
- Schema migration applied successfully
- Directory structure created correctly
- API routes created and accessible

### Ready for User Testing:
The following should be tested when the dev server is running:

1. **Quote PDF Generation (No Attachments)**
   - Navigate to any project quote view
   - Click "Download PDF" button
   - Verify PDF downloads with professional layout
   - Check: Quote details, pricing table, elevation images, totals

2. **File Upload**
   - In Quote view, use drag-and-drop to upload PNG/JPG files
   - Try clicking "Click to upload" link
   - Verify files appear in attachment list
   - Test file size validation (try >10MB file)
   - Test file type validation (try .txt or .doc file)

3. **Attachment Management**
   - Upload multiple files
   - Click preview icon on images
   - Delete individual attachments
   - Verify confirmation dialog appears

4. **Quote PDF with Attachments**
   - Upload 1-2 image attachments
   - Click "Download PDF"
   - Verify multi-page PDF includes:
     - Page 1: Quote details and pricing
     - Page 2+: Uploaded attachments (one per page)

5. **Project Deletion**
   - Delete a project that has quote attachments
   - Verify attachment files are cleaned up from disk
   - Verify database records cascade delete properly

## Notes
- Current quote uses html2canvas which has limitations for multi-page
- Shop drawing system already uses jsPDF successfully
- Consider reusing footer/header patterns from pdf-generator.ts
- Quote attachments are project-specific (not global)
