# Review: REMOVE-BANNER-FOOTER
Date Completed: 2025-09-26

## Changes Made
- /home/kyle/projects/Door-Quoter/src/app/page.tsx: Removed orange banner with "ðŸš€ ORANGE BANNER - Rollback Practice v3.0" text
- /home/kyle/projects/Door-Quoter/src/app/layout.tsx: Removed footer with "Door Quoter â€¢ Alpha v1.0 â€¢ Built with Next.js" text

## Testing Performed
- Code review: Verified removals don't affect layout structure
- Layout intact: Main content area flows properly without banner and footer elements

## Notes
- Both banner and footer completely removed without affecting surrounding layout
- Application now has clean interface without promotional/testing banners
