# Review: REMOVE-TEST-BANNER
Date Completed: 2025-09-26

## Changes Made
- /home/kyle/projects/Door-Quoter/src/components/views/DashboardView.tsx: Removed test mode banner (lines 57-65) including the yellow banner with "ðŸ§ª TEST MODE ACTIVE" text

## Testing Performed
- Code review: Verified banner removal doesn't affect other layout elements
- Structure intact: Dashboard header and stats grid remain properly positioned

## Notes
- Banner was completely removed without affecting surrounding components
- Dashboard layout flows naturally from container padding to header section
