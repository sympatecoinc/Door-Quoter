# Review: fix-conversion-rate
Date Completed: 2025-09-27

## Changes Made
- `/home/kyle/projects/Door-Quoter/src/components/views/CRMView.tsx`: Replaced hardcoded conversion rate (25) with dynamic calculation based on actual lead data

## Details
- Added third API call to fetch all leads with stage information
- Implemented conversion rate calculation: (won leads / total leads) * 100
- Added safety check to prevent division by zero when no leads exist
- Conversion rate now updates automatically when leads are modified

## Testing Performed
- Code review: Verified proper handling of edge cases
- Logic verification: Conversion rate calculation follows standard business metrics

## Notes
- Conversion rate now accurately reflects the percentage of leads that have reached "Won" status
- Rate will display 0% when no leads exist (prevents division by zero)
- Changes will be visible immediately when leads are added or their status changes
