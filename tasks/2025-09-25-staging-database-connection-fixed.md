# Review: Fix Staging Database Connection Issue
Date Completed: 2025-09-25 18:25

## Changes Made
- Updated STAGING_DATABASE_URL GitHub secret with correct connection string
- Changed from malformed/empty URL to direct IP connection format: `postgresql://postgres:StagingDB123@35.232.158.172:5432/postgres`
- Triggered two deployment cycles to apply the fix

## Testing Performed
- API endpoint test: ✅ HTTP 200 response
- Database query test: ✅ Returns actual data (2 projects, project details)
- Cloud Run deployment: ✅ Success
- No more "empty host in database URL" errors in logs

## Root Cause Analysis
- STAGING_DATABASE_URL secret was either empty or had malformed connection string
- Cloud Run service couldn't connect to staging database (`door-app-staging`)
- Prisma client initialization was failing with "empty host" error

## Resolution
- Used direct IP connection format instead of Unix socket format
- Database IP: 35.232.158.172 (door-app-staging Cloud SQL instance)
- Connection now successful with proper credentials

## Notes
- Staging database connection fully restored
- API endpoints responding correctly with database data
- Ready for normal staging environment usage
