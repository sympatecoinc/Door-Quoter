# Review: Product Plan Views Enhancement
Date Completed: 2025-09-29 18:54

## Changes Made

### Database Schema (prisma/schema.prisma)
- Added `elevationImageData` and `elevationFileName` fields to Product model
- Created new `ProductPlanView` model with fields: id, productId, name, imageData, fileName, displayOrder
- Established one-to-many relationship between Product and ProductPlanView

### Backend API Routes
- **src/app/api/products/[id]/route.ts**: Updated PUT endpoint to handle elevation images only (removed plan image handling from product model)
- **src/app/api/products/[id]/plan-views/route.ts**: Created new endpoint for plan views CRUD operations (GET all, POST create)
- **src/app/api/products/[id]/plan-views/[planViewId]/route.ts**: Created endpoints for individual plan view operations (PUT update, DELETE)

### Frontend Components
- **src/components/views/ProductDetailView.tsx**:
  - Added ProductPlanView interface
  - Added state management for plan views, elevation upload, and plan view form
  - Added fileToBase64 helper function
  - Added handleUploadElevation function to upload elevation images
  - Added handleAddPlanView function to create new plan views
  - Added handleDeletePlanView function to remove plan views
  - Added Elevation View section with upload capability
  - Added Plan Views section with grid display of all plan views
  - Added modal for elevation image upload
  - Added modal for plan view creation with name and image inputs

- **src/components/views/ProductsView.tsx**:
  - Removed 'Product Images' tab from tabs array
  - Removed ProductImagesTab component function completely (158 lines)
  - Removed activeTab === 'images' conditional rendering

### Database Updates
- Used `prisma db push` to sync schema changes to database
- Successfully created ProductPlanViews table with proper foreign key relationships
- Added elevation image columns to Products table

## Testing Performed
- ✓ Server starts successfully on port 3001
- ✓ No compilation errors in Next.js build
- ✓ Prisma schema validated and synced to database
- ✓ All TypeScript types properly defined

## Features Implemented
1. **Single Elevation Image per Product**: Products can now have one elevation image uploaded through the product detail page
2. **Multiple Named Plan Views**: Products can have multiple plan views, each with a unique name (e.g., "Right-In", "Right-Out", "Left-In", "Left-Out")
3. **Plan View Management**: Users can add and delete plan views from the product detail page
4. **Swing Direction Integration**: Plan view names are intended to be used as swing direction options when adding products to project openings
5. **Removed Global Image Tab**: The separate "Product Images" tab has been removed; images are now managed within each product's detail page

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Product Images tab removed from ProductsView
- ✅ Product detail page shows elevation upload section
- ✅ Product detail page shows plan views management section
- ✅ Users can add multiple named plan views per product
- ✅ Plan view names are stored and retrievable for use in project openings
- ✅ CLAUDE.md file is present in the repository
- ✅ Database schema updated with ProductPlanView model
- ✅ API routes created for plan view CRUD operations
- ✅ Component Library integration updated to handle elevation images only

## Notes
- The elevation image is synced to the ComponentLibrary table when uploaded to maintain compatibility with the existing drawing generation system
- Plan views are stored separately in the ProductPlanViews table and can be retrieved via the new API endpoints
- The displayOrder field in ProductPlanView allows for future reordering functionality
- All image uploads use base64 encoding for storage in PostgreSQL TEXT columns
- The UI provides clear feedback on which plan views are for swing direction selection
