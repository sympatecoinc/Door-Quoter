# Review: Fix TailwindCSS Docker Build Issue
Date Completed: 2025-09-25 17:44

## Changes Made
- Dockerfile: Changed `RUN npm ci --only=production` to `RUN npm ci` on line 11
- next.config.ts: Added `output: 'standalone'` to enable Docker standalone build

## Testing Performed
- GitHub Actions Deploy to Staging: âœ… SUCCESS
- Docker build now completes successfully
- TailwindCSS "Cannot find module" error resolved
- Standalone output directory now generated correctly

## Notes
- CI still has TypeScript errors (separate from Docker build issue)
- Docker deployment pipeline now fully functional
- Staging environment successfully updated with latest changes
- Both issues (missing TailwindCSS and missing standalone output) resolved
